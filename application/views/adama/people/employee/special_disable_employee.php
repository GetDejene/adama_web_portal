                                                        <div> In Kerala, a state wide survey of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) was undertaken by the Kerala Social Security Mission in 2015, the first of its kind in India, covering 22 types of disabilities. As per the survey, 7.94 lakh people equivalent to 2.32 percent of the total population of the State are disabled, of whom, females constitute 44.57 percent, SC 10.93 percent and ST 2.15 percent. The highest number of disabled persons is in Malappuram district (12.5 per cent) followed by Thiruvananthapuram (9.72 per cent) and the lowest in Wayanad district (2.91 per cent). Regarding type of disabilities, locomotor disability stands top with 32.89 percent and multiple disabilities stand second 17.31 percent.PwDs often lack access to good quality basic and higher education.</div>

                                                        <div> To enhance the standard of living of PwDs with the help of time-bound programmes and action plans of the State, the Government of Kerala enacted the State Policy for Persons with Disabilities. Government of Kerala enacted a policy for PwDs in the year 2015 recognising the necessity and inevitability of including disability dimensions in the development agenda, programmes and action plans of the State. Participation of PwDs in the developmental process, viewing disability as a human rights issue, protection from abuse and creating a positive environment and attitude for inclusive development and empowerment of PwDs are the key strategic focal dimensions of the policy. From being passive beneficiaries, the disabled have to be considered as equal partners and contributors to development.To read the policy: <strong><a class="one" href="documents/10180/46696/Kerala%20State%20Policy%20for%20Persons%20with%20Disabilities%202015.pdf">Click here</a></strong></div>
