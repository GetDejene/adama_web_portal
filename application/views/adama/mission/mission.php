Now, the focus is on people friendly health delivery system by converting PHCs into Family Health Centres and Taluk-District hospitals into super speciality hospitals, which are the key objectives of the mission, AARDRAM.</div>
                                                        <div> &nbsp;</div>
                                                        <div> Following landmark implementation of land reforms, educational reforms, literacy campaign and people's campaign for decentralization, the State is now taking up the Nava Adamam Karma Padhathi to build on and consolidate our gains of the yesteryears.</div>

                                                        <div> People's participation and leadership by the Local Self Government Institutions is the key to the implementation of these programmes. I am sure that the four missions, which are aimed at building a new Adama, will definitely change the development scenario of the State.</div>
                                                        <div> &nbsp;</div>
                                                        <div> Ever since the formation in 1956, the State of Adama has attempted sustaining reform measures with a long term vision and strengthening the foundation of its development. Land reforms, Educational reforms, Literacy campaigns, People's Planning campaigns, Police reforms including Jana Maithri Police and the Knowledge Revolution are some in the long list of such initiatives. The latest effort is based on a very contemporary and innovative mission mode known as the Nava Adamam Karma Padhathi (NKKP) encompassing in itself four missions covering six prioritized sectors of the State. The NKKP has been designed to touch the lives and livelihoods of the ordinary citizen of the states in all walks of life levels of governance. It is proposed to be implemented with massive public participation and Local Self Government Institutions in the driving seat.</div>

                                                        <p> Nava Adamam Karma Padhathi aims to bring basic socio - economic services in a qualitative manner to those who have so far been excluded from the various development initiatives of the past. There will be a clear targeting of the poorest of the poor, the most vulnerable sections of the society including widows without support, the aged, the terminally ill, the tribal population and so on. The â€˜business as usual' approach of government programs will be replaced with carefully planned and systematically implemented programs with a clear thrust on results. The core of the implementation strategy is that the state and district level departmental machinery will converge their development efforts meaningfully at the level of local self-government institutions. All services and support will converge on the ordinary households in the state.</p>
