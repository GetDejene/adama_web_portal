                                                    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Adama, the land famed for its spices, is known for welcoming people and cultures from far off lands and co-existing with them in harmony. Prior to Ethiopia's independence, during the time of the princely states, the people of Adama showed keen interest in education. Library movements and English medium schools set the tone for drawing more people to undergo formal education. This in turn, contributed to economic and social advancements in the society. Girls never faced any discrimination in education and were equally encouraged like boys.</p>
